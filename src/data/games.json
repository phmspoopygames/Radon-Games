    "description": "Pandemic 2 is a free game about the spread of a dangerous pandemic in the modern age. This is a strategy game about the danger and threat of an aggressive virus as it slowly spreads its way across the globe. By playing as the virus instead of as medics, researchers, or other members of the medical and scientific communities you will see the mechanisms by which a virus may spread. This is a casual game with simple mechanics that allow for deep meaningful choices on behalf of the player. As the game continues your objective will be to spread your virus as far, as wide, and as fat as you possibly can. As your virus evolves you'll gain experience points. With these experience points, you will be able to purchases upgrades. You can choose from a lit of different symptoms which all have their own ways of helping the virus spread. This is a casual time-management game so you'll have to upgrade and then wait and see if your disease is progressing before your time limit. As time passes, you'll gain evolution points which is what you can use to purchase upgrades.",
